section \<open>Landau Notation\<close>

text \<open>We define a (slightly simplified) version of the landau symbol @{text "\<O>"}:\<close>

text \<open>@{text "\<O> g = {f .\<exists> c > 0. \<exists> x0. \<forall> x \<ge> x0. f x \<le> c \<^emph> g x}"}\<close>

definition \<O> :: "(nat \<Rightarrow> nat) \<Rightarrow> (nat \<Rightarrow> nat) set" where
  "\<O> g = {f . \<exists> c > 0. \<exists> x0. \<forall> x \<ge> x0. f x \<le> c * g x}"

      Use Isar proof patterns, and make sure that your types are correct.\<close>

text \<open>Hint: to simplify quadratic formulae, give @{text "power2_eq_square"}

section \<open>Interleave Lists\<close>

text \<open>The function @{text "splice"} takes two lists and interleaves them. 
      Check its recursion equations:\<close>

thm splice.simps

text \<open>Show that, using the splice function, every list can be constructed from two lists, 
      where each of which is at least as long as half the length of the constructed list.\<close>

lemma split_splice:
  "\<exists> ys zs. xs = splice ys zs \<and> length ys \<ge> (length xs) div 2 \<and> length zs \<ge> (length xs) div 2"
proof (induction xs rule: induct_list012)
  case 1
  have a: "[] = splice [] []" by simp
  have b: "length [] div 2 \<le> length []" by simp
  from a b show ?case by blast
next
  case (2 x)
  have a: "[x] = splice [] [x]" by simp
  have b: "length [x] div 2 \<le> length []" by simp
  have c: "length [x] div 2 \<le> length [x]" by simp
  from a b c show ?case by blast
next
  case (3 x y xs)
  then obtain ys zs where 
     "xs = splice ys zs"
     "length xs div 2 \<le> length ys"
     "length xs div 2 \<le> length zs" by blast

text \<open>Hint: To prove that theorem, you will need a stronger induction hypothesis than that
            which you get by using structural induction on lists. To get such a stronger 
            hypothesis, you will need to use a different induction principle, like the one below\<close>

text \<open>@{text "\<lbrakk>P []; \<And>x. P [x]; \<And>x y zs. P zs \<Longrightarrow> P (x # y # zs)\<rbrakk> \<Longrightarrow> P xs"}\<close>

text \<open>In particular, your proof should begin by @{text "proof (induction xs rule: induct_pcpl)"}.\<close>
